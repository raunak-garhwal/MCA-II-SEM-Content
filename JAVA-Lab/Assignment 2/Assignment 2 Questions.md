# Java Assignment Questions

1. Encapsulation: Write a Java program to create a class Student with private fields for name, age, and grade. Provide public getter and setter methods for each field. Ensure that the age and grade are within a valid range (e.g., age between 5 and 25, grade between 1 and 10).

2. Inheritance: Create a class Person with fields for name and age. Create a subclass Employee that adds a field for salary and a method to display employee details. Write a main method to create and display an employee's details.

3. Polymorphism: Define a base class Shape with a method draw(). Create two subclasses, Circle and Rectangle, that override the draw() method. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the draw() method on an array of Shape objects that include instances of Circle and Rectangle.

4. Classes and Data Abstraction: Design an abstract class BankAccount with abstract methods deposit(double amount) and withdraw(double amount). Create a subclass SavingsAccount that implements these methods and maintains a balance. Write a program to demonstrate the functionality.

5. Constructors and Destructors: Write a class Book with a parameterized constructor to initialize the book's title, author, and price. Include a destructor (using the finalize method) that prints a message when an object is garbage collected. Create and destroy a few Book objects in the main method. 

6. Packages: Create a package named com.example.shapes. Inside this package, define a class Circle with methods to calculate the area and circumference. Write a program to use this package and demonstrate the functionality.

7. Interfaces: Define an interface Vehicle with methods start() and stop(). Create two classes Car and Bike that implement this interface. Write a program to demonstrate the use of the interface by calling the methods on objects of Car and Bike. 

8. Access Control: Create a class Library with fields for book title, author, and ISBN. Use different access modifiers (private, protected, public) for these fields. Write methods to access and modify these fields appropriately. Demonstrate access control in a main method.

9. Method Overriding: Create a base class Animal with a method makeSound(). Create subclasses Dog and Cat that override the makeSound() method. Write a program to demonstrate method overriding by calling the makeSound() method on objects of Dog and Cat.
